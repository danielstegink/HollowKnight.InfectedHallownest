# Infected Hallownest

This mod adds a new layer of complexity to the dreaded Infection. 

In the game, when you either acquire the Monarch Wings or defeat one of the Dreamers,
the Forgotten Crossroads become overwhelmed by Infection, replacing many of the enemies with
stronger versions of themselves.

In the spirit of this, I've added an additional stage to the Infection's progression.
After you defeat the Hollow Knight, the Infection spreads beyond the Forgotten Crossroads,
causing various enemies throughout the game to have a chance to be extra Infected.

Extra Infected enemies will flash orange repeatedly and have twice as much health.
